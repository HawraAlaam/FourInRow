### ***Description***
#### Four in a Row, is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to be the first player to get four of their own colored discs in a continuous line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, within the grid. Players must strategically block their opponent's attempts to connect four while working to build their own line of four.
